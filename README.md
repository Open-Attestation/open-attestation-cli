# OpenAttestation (CLI)

This command line interface tool in the [OpenAttestation CLI](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/open-attestation-cli) repository turns `.json` documents into OpenAttestation verifiable documents. It applies the OpenAttestation algorithm to produce a hash of the `.json` document, and then creates a file with the data and proof of integrity.

## Installation

There are two ways to install the CLI, including binary and NPM. Additionally, you can use NPX to execute the code in the package directly.

### Binary

To install the binary on your operating system, download the corresponding file from the [CLI release page](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/open-attestation-cli/releases).

>**Note:** There is an existing issue that the size of the binaries must be reduced, which is tracked in GitHub. If you want to contribute your feedback to resolve it, see [this issue here](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/open-attestation-cli/issues/68).

### NPM

If you are a Linux or MacOS user with `npm` installed on your machine, you can also install the CLI using the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @govtechsg/open-attestation-cli
```

The above command will install the open-attestation CLI to your machine. Be sure to have `node.js` installed, so that you can run the command.

### NPX

If you only want to execute a few commands, you can also opt to use `npx`:

```bash
npx -p @govtechsg/open-attestation-cli open-attestation <arguments>
```

Upon installation, a configuration folder will be created at `~/.config/open-attestation/`.

>**Important:** The CLI is referred to as `open-attestation` when you run a command. The assumption is the CLI is available in your execution path. If not, you must change `open-attestation` to reflect the full path to the executable.

## Usage

### Network fees

For more information on network fees, see the [Ethereum documentation](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/).

#### Adjusting preset gas price

To adjust transaction gas price, use the `priority` variable to scale against the market price.

>**Calculation:** Priority \* Previous block priority fee = Priority fee to use

The table below shows some examples:

| Priority | Previous block priority fee | Priority fee to use |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1        | 1                           | 1 \* 1 = 1          |
| 1.2      | 1                           | 1.2 \* 1 = 1.2      |
| 2        | 1                           | 2 \* 1 = 2          |
| 1        | 10                          | 1 \* 10 = 10        |
| 1.2      | 10                          | 1.2 \* 10 = 12      |
| 2        | 10                          | 2 \* 10 = 20        |

#### Fee information

To display an estimated price of a transaction, use the `--dry-run` option in your command.

The following shows a command example:

```bash
open-attestation deploy document-store "My Name" --network sepolia --dry-run
```

The response looks like:

```bash

### Wrapping documents

The `wrap` command processes all documents in the input directory. It will add the issuance proofs to the individual documents. Additionally, you'll get the Batch Document Root (`merkleRoot`) value. Thereafter, you can issue all the documents in a single batch with the `merkleRoot` later.

The following shows a command example:

```bash
open-attestation wrap ./examples/raw-documents/example.0.json
```
The response looks like:

```
✔  success  Batch Document Root: 0xf51030c5751a646284c898cff0f9d833c64a50d6f307b61f2c96c3c838b13bfc
```
#### Specifying the output file while wrapping documents

The `wrap` command will display the result in the console. If you need to save the file, use the `--output-file` option in your command.

The following shows a command example with the `--output-file` option:

```bash
open-attestation wrap ./examples/raw-documents/example.0.json --output-file ./examples/wrapped-documents/example.0.json
```
The response looks like:

```
✔  success   Batch Document Root: 0x5d318c8083aac18f8075ca2a2eac74b06f2cc37d6ccad680c7c80c9bb36f7be1
```
#### Specifying the output directory while wrapping documents

If you need to wrap a folder, use the `--output-dir` option to specify in which folder all the documents will be wrapped.

The following shows a command example with the `--output-dir` option:

```bash
open-attestation wrap ./examples/raw-documents --output-dir ./examples/wrapped-documents
```
The response looks like:

```
✔  success   Batch Document Root: 0x5d318c8083aac18f8075ca2a2eac74b06f2cc37d6ccad680c7c80c9bb36f7be1
```

#### Providing an optional JSON schema while wrapping documents
You can also provide an optional JSON schema document using the `--schema` option to perform an extra check on the documents.

The following shows a command example with the `--schema` option:

```bash
open-attestation wrap ./examples/raw-documents/ --output-dir ./examples/wrapped-documents/ --schema ./examples/schema.json
```

The response looks like:

```
✔  success  Batch Document Root: 0xf51030c5751a646284c898cff0f9d833c64a50d6f307b61f2c96c3c838b13bfc
```

##### Short form of the `--schema` option

Alternatively, you can use `-s` in the command, which is the short form of `--schema`. 

```bash
open-attestation wrap ./examples/raw-documents/ ./examples/wrapped-documents/ -s ./examples/schema.json
```

The response looks like: 
```
✔  success  Batch Document Root: 0xf51030c5751a646284c898cff0f9d833c64a50d6f307b61f2c96c3c838b13bfc
```

##### HTTP endpoint in the `--schema` option 

The `schema` parameter also accepts a remote JSON schema.

The following shows a command example containing an HTTP endpoint:

```bash
open-attestation wrap ./examples/raw-documents/ --output-dir ./examples/wrapped-documents/ --schema https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Nebulis/dd8198ab76443489e14121dad225d351/raw/693b50a1694942fb3cc6a8dcf5187cc7c75adb58/schema.json
```
The response looks like:

```
✔  success  Batch Document Root: 0xf51030c5751a646284c898cff0f9d833c64a50d6f307b61f2c96c3c838b13bfc
```
##### HTTP endpoint in the short form `-s`

Similarly, you can also use the short form `-s` to replace the `--schema` option in the command:

```bash
open-attestation wrap ./examples/raw-documents/ --output-dir ./examples/wrapped-documents/ -s https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Nebulis/dd8198ab76443489e14121dad225d351/raw/693b50a1694942fb3cc6a8dcf5187cc7c75adb58/schema.json
```
The response looks like:

```
✔  success  Batch Document Root: 0xf51030c5751a646284c898cff0f9d833c64a50d6f307b61f2c96c3c838b13bfc
```
#### Editing a wrapped document

You can also re-wrap a document through editing the wrapped document content and using the `--unwrap` option. 

1. Run the command below to wrap a raw document:

    ```bash
    open-attestation wrap ./examples/raw-documents/example.0.json --output-file ./examples/wrapped-documents/example.0.json
    ```
2. After the first round of wrapping, edit the content in the wrapped document. For example, change your name to another name in `example.0.json`. 

3. To re-wrap the document after editing, run the command below with the `--unwrap` option:

    ```bash
    open-attestation wrap ./examples/wrapped-documents/example.0.json --of ./examples/wrapped-documents/example.1.json --unwrap
    ```

#### Wrapping documents individually

You can disable the `--batched` option to wrap multiple documents individually. Consequently, these documents will not have the same merkle root.

The following shows a command example with the `--batched` option disabled:

```bash
open-attestation wrap ./examples/raw-documents/ --output-dir ./examples/wrapped-documents/ --batched false
```
The response looks like:

```
✔  success   All documents have been individually wrapped
```

#### Changing the OpenAttestation CLI version

By default, the CLI will use OpenAttestation schema V2, but you can opt in for OpenAttestation schema V3 using the `--open-attestation-v3` option:

```bash
open-attestation wrap ./examples/raw-documents/ ./examples/wrapped-documents/ --open-attestation-v3
```
Alternatively, you can use the short form `--oav3` to replace `--open-attestation-v3` in the command:

```bash
open-attestation wrap ./examples/raw-documents/ ./examples/wrapped-documents/ --oav3
```

>**Note:** Transferable Records must be wrapped individually as each of them will be minted to a unique title escrow that represents the document's beneficiary and holder entities. For more information about title escrow, see [here](https://www.openattestation.com/docs/transferable-section/overview-tr).

### Unwrapping documents

The `unwrap` command processes a  wrapped document in the input directory. It will unwrap it to its raw document form, and display it in the console.

The following shows a command example of `unwrap`:

```bash
open-attestation unwrap ./examples/v2/wrapped-documents/example.0.json
```
The response looks like:

```
✔  success   The document has been unwrapped
```

#### Specifying the output file while unwrapping documents

The `unwrap` command will display the result in the console. If you need to save the file, use the `--output-file` option.

The following shows a command example with the `--output-file` option:

```bash
open-attestation unwrap ./examples/v2/wrapped-documents/example.0.json --output-file ./examples/v2/raw-documents/example.0.json
```
The response looks like:

```
✔  success   The document has been unwrapped
```

#### Specifying the output directory while unwrapping documents

If you need to unwrap a folder, use the `--output-dir` option to specify in which folder all the documents will be unwrapped.

The following shows a command example with the `--output-dir` option:

```bash
open-attestation unwrap ./examples/v2/wrapped-documents --output-dir ./examples/v2/raw-documents
```
The response looks like:

```
✔  success   The documents have been individually unwrapped into folder ./examples/v2/raw-documents
```

### Document privacy filter

Using the `filter` command, the document holders can generate valid documents and obfuscate certain fields, such as those fields containing sensitive information that they prefer not to disclose.

The following shows the syntax of the `filter` command:

```bash
open-attestation filter <inputDocumentPath> <outputDocumentPath> [filters...]
```

The following is a command example:

```bash
open-attestation filter examples/wrapped-documents/example.0.json tmp/example.0.out.json key1
```
The response looks like:

```
✔  success  Obfuscated document saved to: tmp/example.0.out.json
```

### Encrypting a document

With the `encrypt` command, you can encrypt the documents to share and store them safely.

The following shows the syntax of the `encrypt` command:

```bash
open-attestation encrypt <inputDocumentPath> <outputEncryptedPath>
```

The following is a command example:

```bash
open-attestation encrypt ./examples/wrapped-documents/example.0.json ./tmp/encrypted.json
```

The response looks like:
```
✔  success   Encrypted document saved to: tmp/encrypted.json
⚠  warning   Here is the key to decrypt the document: don't lose it: 9bac5be27bac31d852fc1e48eb9d5249ec6ad7978da23377b5879f7a24994cb2
```

### Decrypting a document

Using the `decrypt` command, you can decrypt documents that were encrypted using the [encrypt](#encrypting-a-document) method.

The following shows the syntax of the `decrypt` command:

```bash
open-attestation decrypt <input> <output> <key>
```

The following is a command example:

```bash
open-attestation decrypt ./src/__tests__/fixture/did-dns-encrypted.json decrypted.json 88da9b9cd61cfc1677ae7e79dba9b3aeba4b40c95f94c950759e76c6210b5402
```
The response looks like:

```
✔  success   Decrypted document saved to: decrypted.json
```

### Token Registry

#### Deploying a new Token Registry

The `deploy token-registry` command deploys a token registry contract on the blockchain. You can use the `--factory-address` flag with the Factory Contract that were deployed using this command. 

To deploy a standalone token registry, refer to the [Token-Registry](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/token-registry) repository.

The following shows the syntax of the `deploy token-registry` command:

```bash
open-attestation deploy token-registry <registry-name> <registry-symbol> --factory-address <factory-address> [options]
```
For more ways to provide the wallet, see [here](#providing-the-wallet).

The following command is a recommended example with the private key set in the `OA_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable. 

```bash
open-attestation deploy token-registry "My Sample Token" MST --network sepolia
```

The response looks like:

```
✔  success   Token registry deployed at 0x4B127b8d5e53872d403ce43414afeb1db67B1842
```

#### Issuing a document to token registry

The `token-registry issue` command issues a hash to a token registry deployed on the blockchain. 

* The `--tokenId` option indicates the document hash
* The `--beneficiary`  option indicates the beneficiary's wallet address
* The `--holder` option indicates the document holder's wallet address

The following shows the syntax of the `token-registry issue` command:

```bash
open-attestation token-registry issue --network <NETWORK> --address <TOKEN_REGISTRY_ADDRESS> --tokenId <TOKEN_ID> --beneficiary <BENEFICIARY> --holder <HOLDER> [options]
```
>**Important:** In this command, you can use `mint` instead of `issue` and they will be strictly equivalent.

For more ways to provide the wallet, see [here](#providing-the-wallet).

In the example below: 
* You will use 0x6FFeD6E6591b808130a9b248fEA32101b5220eca as beneficiary and holder.
* You will need to replace the value above with a wallet address you control, to be able to perform different actions on the transferable records later.

- private key ....
```

#### Providing the wallet

When interacting with blockchain, you need to provide a way to access your wallet. All functions that require this provide multiple ways for you to enter your wallet information:

1. It is recommended to use the `--encrypted-wallet-path` option where you provide a path to an [encrypted wallet](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/#Wallet-encrypt).

1. Use the `OA_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable to hold the private key.

1. Use the `--key-file` option where you provide a path to a file containing the private key.

1. Use the `--key` option where you provide the private key directly to the command.

>**Important:** When you use the `--key` option, the private key may be stored in the machine's bash history.

The following is a code example using the `--encrypted-wallet-path` option:

```bash
open-attestation deploy document-store "My Name" --network sepolia --encrypted-wallet-path /path/to/wallet.json
```
The response looks like:

```bash
# Then you will be prompted to type your password to decrypt the wallet
? Wallet password [input is hidden]

# Using environment variable
export OA_PRIVATE_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
open-attestation deploy document-store "My Name" --network sepolia
unset OA_PRIVATE_KEY

# Using private key stored in file
echo -n 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002 >> ./examples/sample-key
open-attestation deploy document-store "My Name" --network sepolia --key-file ./examples/sample-key
rm ./examples/sample-key

# Providing the key to the command
open-attestation deploy document-store "My Name" --network sepolia --key 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003
```

### Creating the configuration file

The `config create` command generates a configuration file named `config.json` with sandbox DNS, document store, and token registry.

>**Note:** You need a `wallet.json` file with sufficient **funds** in the specified network for this command to work. Currently, OpenAttestation does not provide any faucet to dispense funds into `wallet.json`. You can search online for some faucets.

You can use the following options in this command:

- `--output-dir` option specifies in which folder the configuration file will be created.
- `--encrypted-wallet-path` option indicates a path to an [encrypted wallet](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/#Wallet-encrypt).

- `--config-template-url` option provides a path to reference a configuration template file hosted on a public URL.

- `--config-template-path` option provides a path to reference a config template file locally.

There are two ways of using this command to generate a configuration file. Both ways will return a new configuration file with the sandbox DNS, updated document store, and updated token registry.

#### Method 1: Using the `config-template-url` option (recommended)

These are the reference config templates:

- [V2 config template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TradeTrust/tradetrust-config/master/build/reference/config-v2.json)
- [V3 config template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TradeTrust/tradetrust-config/master/build/reference/config-v3.json)

Step 1. Make sure the `wallet.json` file has sufficient funds.

```bash
open-attestation wallet create --output-file wallet.json
```

Step 2. Generate the configuration file by providing the `wallet.json` file and a URL to the configuration file template.

```
open-attestation config create --output-dir ./example-configs --encrypted-wallet-path </path/to>/wallet.json
```

You need to provide certain information in the response:

```
// Please fill in the necessary information when prompted.
ℹ  info      Creating a new config file
? Wallet password [hidden]
? Using a config template URL? Yes
? Please enter the config template URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TradeTrust/tradetrust-config/master/build/reference/config-v2.json
? Select Network sepolia
```

#### Method 2: Using the `config-template-path` option

Step 1. Make sure the `wallet.json` file has sufficient funds.

```bash
open-attestation wallet create --output-file wallet.json
```

Step 2. Generate the configuration file by providing the `wallet.json` file and an existing configuration file.

```bash
open-attestation config create --output-dir ./example-configs --encrypted-wallet-path </path/to>/wallet.json
```

You need to provide certain information in the response:

```
// Please fill in the necessary information when prompted.
ℹ  info      Creating a new config file
? Wallet password [hidden]
? Using a config template URL? No
? Please enter the config template path </path/to>/config.json
? Select Network sepolia
```

### Canceling a pending transaction

The `transaction cancel` command cancels a pending transaction.

>**Important:** This action is irreversible.

You need to use the following options:

- `--nonce` option specifies which transaction is to be canceled.

- `--gas-price` option specifies the gas price, which is required to be higher than the pending transaction.

- `--transaction-hash` option can be used as an alternative to the `--nonce` and `--gas-price` options. It will automatically increase the transaction gas price by 100%.

- To learn more about the options for providing the wallet, see [this GitHub readme](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/open-attestation-cli#providing-the-wallet).

The following is the command syntax:

```bash
open-attestation transaction cancel --nonce <pending transaction nonce> --gas-price <gas price> [option]
```

The following shows a command example with the `--nonce` option:

```bash
open-attestation transaction cancel --nonce 1 --gas-price 300 --network sepolia --encrypted-wallet-path /path/to/wallet
```
The following shows another example with the `--transaction-hash` option:

```bash
open-attestation transaction cancel --transaction-hash 0x000 --network sepolia --encrypted-wallet-path /path/to/wallet
```

### Title escrow

#### Changing the holder

Using the `title-escrow change-holder` command, the owner of a transferable record can change the holder.

The following shows the command syntax:

```bash
open-attestation title-escrow change-holder --token-registry <TOKEN_REGISTRY_ADDRESS> --tokenId <TOKEN_ID> --newHolder <NEW_HOLDER> [options]

### Wrap

Using the `npm run benchmark` command, you can monitor the response time spent on wrapping a batch of documents.

The default command (with no options) will test two documents without `base64` image in one iteration:

```
npm run benchmark
```

The number of documents and iterations can be modified using these options below:

- First argument: The number of documents for batched wrapping
- Second argument: The number of performance test iterations to achieve higher accuracy
- Third argument: The file path for testing 

    >**Important:** For the Windows user, be sure to provide the file path in quotation marks "".

The following is a command example, testing four documents in one iteration from the specified path:

```bash
npm run benchmark 4 1 performance-tests/unwrapped_document_wImage.json
```
